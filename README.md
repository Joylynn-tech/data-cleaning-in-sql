cleaning data in SQL
 I rapidly validate anomalies, parse freeform values, reconcile duplicates, handle invalid entries, and meet business rules through derived columns and creative use cases for functions like CASE, LAG(), REGEX, and window calculations. I build scalable data hygiene solutions that refresh flawed data for accuracy, completeness and consistency so you can trust the integrity of data feeds powering mission-critical business decisions.
